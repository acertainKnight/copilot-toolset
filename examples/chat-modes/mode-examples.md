## Mode Integration Examples

### Using Multiple Modes Together

```bash
# Architecture planning with cloud architect
@cloud-architect Design the overall system architecture for our new SaaS platform.

# Store the architectural decisions
Remember our architectural decisions: microservices on AWS with API Gateway, Lambda functions, and Aurora PostgreSQL.

# Switch to security review
@security-auditor Review the proposed architecture for security concerns and compliance requirements.

# Development implementation
@frontend-specialist Now let's implement the React admin dashboard for this architecture.

# Documentation
@tech-writer Create documentation for the API endpoints we've defined.
```

### Project-Specific Mode Workflows

```bash
# 1. Initialize project
@cloud-architect Initialize this project as a serverless e-commerce platform on AWS.

# 2. Store project context
Remember: This is an e-commerce platform using Next.js frontend, AWS Lambda backend, DynamoDB for products, and Stripe for payments.

# 3. Switch contexts for specific tasks
@ecommerce-expert Design the shopping cart logic with inventory management.
@security-auditor Review the payment processing flow for PCI compliance.
@performance-optimizer Optimize the product search and filtering functionality.
```

## Verification and Testing

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Specific System Prompts**: Make prompts detailed and domain-specific
2. **Appropriate Tools**: Choose tools that match the mode's purpose
3. **Temperature Settings**: Lower for technical precision, higher for creativity
4. **Clear Descriptions**: Write clear mode descriptions for team use
5. **Regular Updates**: Update modes as project requirements evolve
6. **Memory Integration**: Use memory tools to store mode-specific knowledge
7. **Team Coordination**: Share mode configurations across team members
